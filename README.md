#############Raw Notes, DO NOT MODIFY THIS SECTION##############

Project made with Next.js, React, TailwindCSS

Initial designs made with ChatGPT, animated visuals mostly [AceternityUI](https://ui.aceternity.com/) (sparkles, vortex, animated modal...)

Initial backend approach -> analyse AST for quantum-speed-up-able structures {get AST via Babel}

15.04. "What's going on here?" - After showing the implementation to a few friends/acquaintances/mentors, the feedback was "I don't get it", "What if I don't code? I just open, look at this and leave?", "So, if there's no advantage, then I just leave the page feeling like I've wasted my time?" {rephrased - the actual phrasing for some was less "proper"}

Todos:
code assessment:
-caching
-security
-error handling
-testing
-pull & recalculate data based on pricings
-more accurate qubit & gate calculations
Advanced: train ML to better predict classical vs. quantum speedups
